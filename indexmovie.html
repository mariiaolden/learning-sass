      <h3>Aquaman's Jason Momoa Reveals Advice He Received From X-Men Star</h3>
      <p>Jason Momoa has revealed that ahead of filming DC's upcoming Aquaman film, he was offered a pearl of wisdom from none other than X-Men star Michael Fassbender. Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger in 1941, the character made his DCEU debut in 2017's Justice League. Although the film proved to be a critical and commercial disappointment, DC and Warner Bros remained steadfast in their plans for a solo adventure. The return of the sea-faring hero will mark the first standalone outing since the blockbuster team-up, with many fans hoping it'll serve as a turning point in the collective franchise.</p>
